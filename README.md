# Learning "C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4"

This repository documents my journey of learning Qt through the classic book **"C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4, Second Edition"** by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark Summerfield. It contains my personal study notes, solutions to exercises, and all the practice code, adapted for a modern Qt environment (Qt 5/6).

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

* To systematically master the fundamentals of Qt GUI programming.
* To practice implementing the examples from the book.
* To document the differences and necessary adaptations when migrating code from Qt 4 to Qt 5/6.
* To create a well-organized, reusable personal knowledge base for future reference.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories: `docs` for study notes and `projects` for source code.
